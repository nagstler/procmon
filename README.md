ProcMon is a simple command-line tool, built in Go, that monitors one or more system processes simultaneously by their names. If a process isn't found, consumes too much CPU, or gets terminated, it sends alerts directly to a specified Slack channel.

## Features

- Monitor any process by its name
- Monitor multiple processes simultaneously
- Sends an alert to a Slack channel if the process is not found or terminated
- Sends an alert if a process's CPU usage exceeds 80%
- Resumes monitoring when the process is restarted

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.16 or higher)
- [Slack Bot Token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nagstler/procmon.git
cd procmon
```

Build the tool:

```bash

go build -o procmon
```

## Usage

To use ProcMon, you need to provide a configuration file in YAML format (`config.yaml`). The file should contain your Slack bot token and the ID of the Slack channel where you want to send alerts:

```yaml
slack:
  token: 'your-slack-token'
  channel: 'your-channel-id'
processes:
  - 'process-name-1'
  - 'process-name-2'
  - 'process-name-3'
```

Please remember to replace 'your-slack-token' and 'your-channel-id' with your actual Slack bot token and channel ID, and 'process-name-1', 'process-name-2', 'process-name-3' with the names of the processes you want to monitor.

**Never commit your Slack bot token to version control.**

To start monitoring a process, run the following:

```bash
./procmon
```
